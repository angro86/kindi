## Implementation Notes

### YouTube Embed Considerations

1. **Use youtube-nocookie.com** for privacy-enhanced embeds
2. **Enable modest branding** to reduce YouTube UI clutter
3. **Consider playlists** for curated viewing experiences
4. **Monitor Content ID** - some content may have regional restrictions

### Sample Embed Code
```html
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEO_ID?rel=0&modestbranding=1"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### Content Curation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Start with Tier 1 channels (core educational content)
2. **Phase 2**: Add Tier 2 for expanded age coverage
3. **Phase 3**: Add music specialists for variety
4. **Phase 4**: Add story content for passive viewing
