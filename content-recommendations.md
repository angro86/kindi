## Important Notes on Age Ranges

Based on child development research:

- **Traditional nursery rhyme channels** (Cocomelon, Little Baby Bum, ChuChuTV, BabyBus) should be capped at **age 4**, not 6
- Children naturally outgrow nursery rhyme content as they develop more advanced language skills (ages 5+)
- By age 5-6, children benefit more from **story-based content** and **science/exploration** content

## Channels to AVOID

| Channel/Type | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| **Jack Hartman** | Dated production (1990s-2000s aesthetic), not engaging for modern kids |
| **Generic nursery rhyme compilations** | Low quality, recycled public domain content, poor animation |
| **Unboxing/surprise egg channels** | No educational value, promotes consumerism |
| **Channels with excessive ads** | Poor user experience, promotes junk products |
| **Unlicensed character content** | Copyright issues, poor quality knockoffs |
| **Channels with violent/scary content** | Age-inappropriate (e.g., SML/SuperMarioLogan) |
| **"Elsagate" style content** | Inappropriate themes disguised as kids content |

### Red Flags for Production Quality:
- Visuals look pre-2010 or low resolution
- Poor audio quality or robotic voices
- Static/minimal animation
- Repetitive content with minimal variation
- Obvious cost-cutting (same backgrounds, limited character movement)
